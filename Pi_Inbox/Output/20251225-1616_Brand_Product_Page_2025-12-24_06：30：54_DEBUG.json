      "description": "The BasX A2+ can easily be connected to a wide variety of audio signal sources, including stereo preamps, surround sound processors, and the preamp outputs offered by many receivers. Individual inputs are provided for each channel, with balanced inputs via high quality XLR connectors, and unbalanced inputs via industry standard RCA connectors. Speaker connections feature heavy duty insulated five-way speaker binding posts which accept a wide range of speaker cables with banana plugs, spade lugs, or bare wires. A Trigger Input allows the amp to be remotely controlled by a standard trigger output signal from your preamp or receiver.\n\nWhether you’re putting together a new stereo audio system, adding more channels to your current system, or upgrading the performance of the front channels of your current stereo or surround sound receiver, the BasX A2+ is the perfect solution. The BasX A2+ offers advanced design features, including a beefy linear power supply, built around an oversized toroidal power transformer, a high-performance Class A/B output stage, and both balanced and unbalanced inputs. More importantly, the BasX A2+ delivers the true audiophile sound quality you normally expect from far more expensive amplifiers, and all at a truly affordable price.\n\nOutside a heavy steel chassis, and a milled solid aluminum face plate, combine rugged construction and good looks. Inside high-quality circuit boards carefully selected electrical components, and careful attention to wiring layout, ensure both top performance and years of reliable service.\n\nThe BasX A2+ is designed to operate on either 115 VAC or 230 VAC at 50/60 Hz and will automatically detect and configure itself for the proper line voltage. In addition to the standard Trigger Input, the BasX A2+ also offers the option of being configured to turn on automatically when it senses an audio signal at one of its inputs.\n\nThe BasX A2+ is designed to be perfectly stable and sound great, under real world operating conditions, with every normal speaker out there – including both 8 Ohm and 4 Ohm speakers.",
