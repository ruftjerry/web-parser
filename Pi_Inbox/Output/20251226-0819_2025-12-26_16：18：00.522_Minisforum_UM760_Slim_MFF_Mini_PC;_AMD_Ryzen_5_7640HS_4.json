      "description": "The Minisforum UM760 Slim mini pc is equipped with the AMD Ryzen 5 7640HS processor, with 6 cores and 12 threads (Max. frequency up to 5.0 GHz), providing excellent multi-tasking capabilities and high performance. The AMD Radeon 760M integrated GPU supports ultra-high-definition image quality through HDMI 2.1 (8K@60Hz), DP 1.4 (4K@144Hz), and USB4 interfaces (8K@60Hz), meeting the needs of professional work and entertainment. The active cooling system with phase change material reduces CPU temperature by 25% compared to passive heat sinks, ensuring stable and efficient performance under heavy workloads. It delivers a stable 60W performance while the system operates at a noise level below 35dB, keeping your device cool and quiet whether you're working or playing. For networking, the 2.5G WLAN wired network port and Wi-Fi 6E/BT5.3 wireless network card provides a stable network connection (software routers, firewalls, NAT, and network isolation) and fast transmission speeds.",
