Avoid extracting data from filter sidebars (.x-refine), price range selectors, category breadcrumbs, related searches, and sorting dropdown options."

The critical fields to be extracted included the product title, price, and condition, which are typically found in the main content area of the page.

This could be due to incorrect targeting of HTML elements, changes in the page structure, or issues with the extraction script. It is crucial to review the extraction guidelines and ensure that the script is correctly identifying and extracting data from the specified elements. Additionally, the 'endedDate' field was extracted, which was not part of the specified guidelines, indicating a potential misalignment in the extraction focus."
