### Reviews
- **Author:** RickGr4
  - **Date:** 11/24/2024
  - **Title:** Very Happy
  - **Body:** I bought Q750s and a Q650C in 2020. I was pleased with them but as time went on I began to hear some weaknesses in them. I got bitten by the update bug but R Series was not within reach for me. When the Q Meta Series was announced I studied them as much as I could. I came to the conclusion that KEF has addressed and fixed the weak spots in the previous Q Series. I ordered a pair of Q11 Metas and a Q6 Meta. I have had them for about 10 days and even though they are not broken in, the improvements are very easy to hear. From top to bottom they are more detailed and have greater resolution than the old Q Series. They sound larger and have more "air" in the sound. The removed a slightly "boxy" sound the previous Q Series had. I believe the new Q Meta Series is a very worthwhile upgrade over the previous Q Series. I understand that while KEF has closed the gap to the R Series there is still a gap. R Series has even more detail and flatter frequency response. R Series speakers are still on my goal list. It's hard to believe the retail price in the USA of the outgoing Q Series and the new Q Meta Series is the same. Overall I think the new Q Meta Series is a great achievement for KEF and a fabulous bargain in their price range. I am very pleased with mine.
